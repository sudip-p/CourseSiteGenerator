<h2>About</h2>
        
        <p>Course Site Generator was designed and implemented by
            <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/sudip-paul97/'>Sudip Paul</a>
            of <a href='http://www.cs.stonybrook.edu'>Stony Brook University</a>.
            The application was built in order to help learning about making
            user interface frameworks and employs the <strong>PropertiesManager</strong>,
            <strong>jTPS</strong>, and <strong>Desktop Java Framework</strong> libraries,
            created by and maintained by <a href='http://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/~richard'>Richard McKenna.</a>The base
            project was also created by Prof. McKenna.<br />
